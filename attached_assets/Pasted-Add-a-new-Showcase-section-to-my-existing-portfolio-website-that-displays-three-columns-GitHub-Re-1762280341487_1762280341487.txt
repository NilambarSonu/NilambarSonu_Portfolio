Add a new “Showcase” section to my existing portfolio website that displays three columns: GitHub Repos, LeetCode Profile, and Numbers (key metrics). The section should match my site’s visual theme (fonts, colors, spacing, transitions) and be responsive. Use /assets or /public for static assets. Provide careful accessibility and mobile-first layout.

🎯 Layout & Visuals

Full-width section with a subtle gradient or soft card-style background (consistent with my portfolio).

Desktop: three columns side-by-side (equal width).

Tablet/mobile: columns stack vertically (GitHub → LeetCode → Numbers).

Use rounded cards, drop shadows, smooth hover states, and small micro-animations.

Include a section heading like “Showcase” and a short subtitle: My code, problems solved, and key metrics.

🧩 Column 1 — GitHub Repos

Show top 4–6 pinned repos (configurable). Each repo card shows:

Repo name (link opens in new tab)

Short description

Primary language + small color dot

Stars and forks count

“View on GitHub” button

Provide controls: filter by language, sort by stars / updated / name, and a “Load more” button.

Implementation suggestion:

Use GitHub REST API (https://api.github.com/users/<username>/repos?sort=updated&per_page=100) to fetch repos, then pick top ones.

Cache results on client (localStorage) or server to avoid rate limits.

Fallback: read a local repos.json file in /data if API access fails.

🧩 Column 2 — LeetCode Profile

Show LeetCode summary card with:

Username (link to profile)

Total solved, Acceptance rate, Ranking / Contest rating (if available)

Breakdown: Easy / Medium / Hard solved counts (small badges)

Recent activity (last 3 problems), optional tag list (algorithms / DS)

“View on LeetCode” button

Implementation suggestion:

Use a LeetCode stats endpoint or lightweight scraping (explain in README) OR let the user supply a simple JSON (/data/leetcode.json) with fields { solved_total, easy, medium, hard, acceptance, rating }.

If using community APIs, cache results and show friendly “data may be delayed” message.

🧩 Column 3 — Numbers (Key Metrics)

Display 3–6 large numeric metrics with labels and icons, e.g.:

Projects — number of portfolio projects

GitHub Stars — total stars across repos

LeetCode Solved — total solved

Followers — GitHub followers

Years Experience — professional/learning years

Each metric should animate (count-up) on entrance and include a tooltip or small caption.

Make these metrics configurable via a JSON file /data/metrics.json so the user (you) can control which numbers show and their values.
