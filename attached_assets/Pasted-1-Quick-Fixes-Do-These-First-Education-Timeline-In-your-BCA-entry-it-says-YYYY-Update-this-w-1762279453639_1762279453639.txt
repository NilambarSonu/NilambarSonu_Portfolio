1. Quick Fixes (Do These First)
Education Timeline: In your BCA entry, it says "YYYY". Update this with your expected graduation year (e.g., "Expected 2026"). This is very important for recruiters.

Footer Copyright: The footer says "© 2025". Since it's currently 2024, this looks like a typo. Change it to "© 2024" to show attention to detail.

2. Hero Section (Your First Impression)
Profile Image: The silhouette icon is stylish, but a portfolio is about you. I strongly recommend replacing it with a clear, professional-looking headshot. This builds trust and makes the site feel much more personal.

3. "About Me" & "Skills" Section
Expand Your Skills: Your "Skills & Expertise" tags are good but very broad. "HTML-CSS-JS" is one block. "Python for Data Science" is another.

Be Specific: Break these down further.

Example for Web Dev: Add tags for specific frameworks or libraries you know (e.g., React, Node.js, Express.js—if you know them. If not, this is a good next thing to learn!).

Example for Data Science: Add tags for the key libraries you used in your IBM certification (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn).

Add "Tools": Create a separate category for tools like Git, GitHub, VS Code, and Jupyter Notebooks.

4. Projects Section (Most Important Section)
Strengthen Project Descriptions: Your descriptions are very brief (e.g., "A responsive web calculator..."). They say what you built, but not why or how.

Better Description: Instead of just one line, add 2-3 sentences.

Example for "Data Harvesting": "A Python script that uses (e.g., Beautiful Soup and Requests) to scrape data from (e.g., a specific website). The collected data was then cleaned using Pandas and saved to a CSV for analysis."

Functional Links: In the video, the "Live" and "Code" buttons don't seem to be linked. It's critical that these links work.

"Live": Deploy your web projects using services like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages (they are free!).

"Code": Link directly to the GitHub repository for each project.

➕ What to Add
Here are some new additions that will significantly level-up your portfolio.

1. Add "Data Scientist" Projects
Problem: Your title says "Aspiring Data Scientist," but your projects are 5-to-1 in favor of web development. A recruiter for a data science role will notice this mismatch.

Solution: You must add more data science projects.

Add an EDA Project: Find an interesting dataset on Kaggle. Load it into a Jupyter Notebook, clean it, perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Pandas and Matplotlib/Seaborn, and write down your findings. Post this notebook on GitHub and link to it.

Add a Simple ML Project: Use Scikit-learn to build a simple predictive model (e.g., "Titanic Survival Prediction" or "Iris Flower Classification"). This is a classic "hello world" for data science.

2. Add Key Professional Links
GitHub: You need a link to your main GitHub Profile. This is the most important link for any developer. Add it to your "Connect on Social" section or even in the main navigation bar.

LinkedIn: This is the #1 network for professionals. Create a LinkedIn profile, fill it out, and add a link to it in your "Connect on Social" section.

3. Add Your Resume
The "Download Resume" button is excellent. Make sure you have a polished, professional PDF resume linked there.

Summary: Your 3-Step Action Plan
Immediate Fixes: Correct the "YYYY" and "© 2025" typos. Add a professional headshot.

Beef Up Content: Expand your "Skills" section with specific libraries (Pandas, Scikit-learn, etc.) and tools (Git). Make sure all "Live" and "Code" links for your projects are working.

Align with Your Goal: Add 1-2 more Data Science projects (like an EDA notebook) to prove your passion and skills as an "Aspiring Data Scientist." Add your GitHub and LinkedIn links.

This is already a great-looking website. With these changes, it will be much more effective at showcasing your skills to recruiters.
